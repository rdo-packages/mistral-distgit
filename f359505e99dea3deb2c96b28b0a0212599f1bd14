The \u0027other readable/execute\u0027 bits need to be removed from the /var/log/mistral directory\n\nIt is unclear from the description which specific \"sensitive information\" is leaked so I\u0027m not sure proposed fix is correct: logs should not contain sensitive info and bugfix should be to conceal it before sending to logs\nlike for example password parameters in oslo.config: https://github.com/openstack/oslo.config/commit/0e4f86ec0998779b1ef4a1ae72a985d823886ff4\n\n\nThe plan is to centralize logs collection using Opstools SIG and removing log readability might break fluentd agent.",
